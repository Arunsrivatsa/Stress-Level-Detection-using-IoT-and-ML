Implemented Stress Level Detection model using Spo2 and heart rate, Vibration sensors.

– Tools & technologies used: AWS,Arduino IDE,Python

– Used AWS Cloud for data collection, Lambda function and Dynamo DB to store and process the data for the
detection of stress levels.

– A Streamlit web app deploys a Random Forest model to predict stress levels from user-inputted physiological data.
